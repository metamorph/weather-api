* Backlog
** Setup Heroku account and bootstrap app

To get a quick turn-around deployment to test the next step.

** Create a Hipchat compatible endpoint
Should support the webhook API: https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2/webhooks#room_message

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/weather <city>
/weather at <city>
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Would be cool to use the Cards format

** Implement a client for weather service

- Needs to support current weather and simple forcast
- Check how Heroku handles API-keys (it should be configurable without exposing it in the GIT repository)

** Connect the Hipchat adapter to the weather api

** Caching!

- Add caching using https://github.com/clojure/core.memoize

** Add more weather features || Add different frontend adapter (Slack?)
